In the settings screen, users are able to change the background and the snake head model. 
In the level selection screen, users are able to choose the difficulty of the game by selecting the radio button. 
When play is clicked, the game will start. In the playing field, there are fences that increase the difficulty of the game.

If the snake makes contact with the fences, the game will end. 
When the game ends, the user will be presented the final score, which is located at the center of the screen.
